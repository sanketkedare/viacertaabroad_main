However with the visa requirement getting stricter also rising tuition fees and political tension between the countries, moving abroad has become a challenge. And thus many Indian students are looking at alternatives that are hassle-free.\n\nAnd thus, the international degree without leaving the country could be a game changer for all the Indian students. The University of Southampton India Campus has already set up shop in Gurgaon, Delhi, with an inaugural intake commencing in August 2025. Others like New Castle University India Campus, Surrey University India, and Coventry University India are following the suit.

It is no secret that the visa rules have become a lot stricter and due to this the Uk Universities for Indian students are facing financial strain. International students have historically contributed significantly to the UK economy through tuition fees and related expenditures. UK’s stricter visa policy has led to a 16% drop in sponsored students visa application between July-September 2024. \n\nBy setting up UK university campuses in India, they can reach students who want global education.\n\nAlso the Indian higher education market is booming with students being eager to get an international degree. By opening campuses here, the UK universities can tap into the huge market of students while offering affordable alternatives for them."

With the UK university campuses in India, you can earn the same degree without leaving your home. Now you can say bye to visa rejections, costly processes, high tuition fees and proof of funds.

While it may not completely replace the experience of living abroad. However affordability, and convenience are what you are looking for then it could be a perfect solution. Some of these campuses may offer study abroad pathways where you can start your degree in India and transfer to the UK later to study or work abroad, so keep an eye out for those programs! \n\nWith the UK universities setting up their campuses in India, moving abroad is no longer the only way to get world-class education and an international degree that is valid worldwide. If you think visa rules and high tuition fees are your roadblocks, then this might be your solution, right here at home. Would you choose to study in India based foreign degree programs or studying abroad is still your dream?"

I had put all my hopes, effort, and money into this, only to see my dreams fall apart. \n\nBut that moment als taught me a lesson and instead of giving up, I chose to dig deeper. I dedicated my hours and my concentration to understanding the aspect of studying abroad. From admissions, visas, finance, and career prospects. I worked in the industry, freelanced for four years, and gathered the knowledge I wish I had when I first started. And that’s when I decided to start ViaCerta Abroad, with a mission to guide the students towards their dream abroad the right way."

We make sure they choose the right course and country, and build a strategy personalized to their goals to land a job and settle successfully. \n\nWe have all seen many stories of students who complete their international degrees and struggle afterwards with unemployment and debt. They find themselves burdened with loans and no clear path forward. And this is exactly what we work to prevent. With the right planning, and the right opportunities, we focus on employability and make sure the students don’t just study abroad, but they thrive abroad."

He had wasted two years, unsure of what to do next. We helped him to get into a master’s program in the UK, and today, he’s on his way to become a certified surgeon. Seeing him succeed reinforced why this mission is so important."

Yes, and every time I face one, I take a step back, analyze what went wrong, and discuss it with experts in the field. Learning and adapting is part of the process.\n\nAnd one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that admission doesn’t guarantee a job and every student needs to think beyond admission. When I studied in the UK, the post-study work visa was just three months. I didn’t find a job in time, and I had to return home. That experience is why I now emphasize long-term career planning for students, ensuring they’re prepared for the job market before they even step into a new country."
